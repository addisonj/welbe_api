A single class is exported by welbe_api.
```JavaScript
var WelbeAPI = require('welbe_api')
var welbe = new WelbeAPI(username, password)
```

Many of the actual URL paths require a `userId`, however this is taken care of for you.
All methods take a single `params` hash and the second argument is a callback.

For Example:
```JavaScript
welbe.trackWater({ounces: 24}, function(err, resp) {
  ...
})
```

The responses are the raw response from the welbe API, most of which aren't documented
